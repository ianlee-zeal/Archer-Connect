## `r` helper
When you are trying to intercept some request you may find that pretty often 
you have to write a bit nasty regular expressions just to be sure 
you are intercepting only requests to a particular endpoint. 

That problem can be solved with `r` helper that provides a more clear way 
to describe url-patterns.

So instead of writing something like this:
```ts
cy.intercept(/\/foo\/bar\/[a-z_]+\/baz\/\d+$/)
```
you can simply write this:
```ts
cy.intercept(r`**/foo/bar/:barName/baz/:bazId<\\d+>`)
```

### URL Patterns Syntax
- `*` will match any characters **except for** the slash "/"
- `**` will match any characters **including** the slash "/". 
It is only allowed when preceded by either the beginning of the string or a slash. 
Likewise it must be followed by a slash or the end of the pattern.
- `:paramName` or `:paramName<regex pattern>` will match a specified RegEx pattern or any characters **except for** the slash "/" if the pattern is not provided.

### Using `r` helper for extracting url-params
You may also find `r` helper useful for extracting url-parameters from the urls.
```ts
const url = 'https://foo.bar/foo/1/bar/2';
const {groups} = r`**/foo/:fooId/bar/:barId`.match(url);

console.log(groups.fooId) // > '1'
console.log(groups.barId) // > '2'
```
